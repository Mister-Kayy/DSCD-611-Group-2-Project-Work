DSCD 611: Programming for Data Scientists I Course Project
Question: 
The 1-page (excluding references and any appendices) proposal should address the following: (1) the topic to be studied; (2) what is known of the topic; (3) why is the topic interesting, relevant, or important; (4) description of data to be used; (5) expected results and impact; and (6) how the project will be done (tools/methods to be used, project plan, and what each team member will do).

Topic: Rainfall and Flood Pattern Analysis
In recent years, unpredictable rainfall patterns and increasing flood incidents have become a major challenge in several communities across Ghana. Areas such as Accra, Kumasi, and Cape Coast experience frequent flash floods following even short periods of rainfall. These floods cause significant damage to infrastructure, disrupt transportation, destroy property, and threaten lives.
The practical problem lies in the lack of accurate rainfall prediction systems and insufficient flood pattern analysis to inform early warning systems and urban planning. Despite access to meteorological data, there is a gap in effectively using this information for community-level decision-making and disaster prevention.
This problem is significant because it affects agriculture, housing, transportation, and public safety. The inability to understand and anticipate rainfall–flood relationships leaves communities vulnerable and unprepared for disasters that could be mitigated with better data and planning.

Description of Data Used: 
The dataset used in this project is the Ghana Rainfall Subnational 5-Year Total dataset. It contains rainfall measurements from different regions of Ghana, recorded over several years. Each record represents a region (identified by a code such as GH02 for Greater Accra) and includes rainfall indicators such as total rainfall (rfh), average rainfall (rfh_avg), 1-hour rainfall (r1h), and 3-hour rainfall (r3h), all measured in millimeters. The data is useful for analyzing rainfall trends and predicting the likelihood of flooding based on heavy rainfall patterns. For this project, the focus is on the Greater Accra region, which is prone to flooding after intense rainfall.

Expected Results and Impact:
The study is expected to uncover significant patterns in rainfall distribution and their relationship with the frequency and intensity of flooding events over time. Through the analysis of historical and contemporary rainfall data, the research will identify temporal and spatial trends, delineate flood-prone zones, and establish correlations between rainfall variability and flood occurrences. The findings may further contribute to the development of predictive models or early warning systems that enhance the accuracy of flood forecasting and risk assessment.
The anticipated impact of the study extends to both policy and practical domains. The results will provide valuable insights for local authorities, urban planners, and disaster management agencies in designing evidence-based strategies for flood control, infrastructure development, and emergency preparedness. Moreover, the findings will promote community awareness, support the formulation of effective environmental and land-use policies, and contribute to broader climate adaptation and resilience-building efforts.

Why the Topic Is Interesting:
Flooding is one of the most common and destructive natural disasters in the world, responsible for a large share of global losses and human displacement. In Ghana, especially within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, floods have become an almost annual challenge. Heavy rainfall between May and July, combined with poor drainage systems, low-lying terrain, and unplanned urban development, often leads to severe flooding that destroys homes, property, and infrastructure. The growing unpredictability of rainfall caused by climate change has made it even harder to prepare for these events. Because of this, it has become increasingly important to develop more effective methods for predicting rainfall and flood patterns. This project aims to use Python and machine learning to analyse historical rainfall data and identify patterns that can help forecast potential flooding. The goal is to help communities, policymakers, and city planners make informed decisions that can reduce damage, save lives, and build a more climate-resilient future for Ghana.
